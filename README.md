## Final Project for CB-DS-COHORT 7

## Jordan Peterson: Friend or Foe?: An exploration in speech senitment using NLP

## Methodology:
Using the principles of Netnography I will attempt a sentimental qualitative analysis of Jordan Peterson and his fanbase utilizing web scraping, nlp, visualization and metric techniques to attempt to derive deep meaning from online community spaces and available subject data. 
The goal of this project is to attempt to understand a cultural phenomena using data analysis with cultural understanding to follow the trends and sentiment within Dr.Jordan Peterson's personal speech and his effect on the public as a whole based upon these intitial research questions:

>-What are his most used words, topics?

-What is their sentiment, and is this stable or changing over time?

>-Does Jordan Peterson's language mimick known alt-right language or sentiments?

-Is he having a political effect on his fans?

>-What kind of effect are his books, lectures and videos having an overall linguistic or social effect on his fans and opposers?

## `Personal Statement and Hypothesis/Research Questions`:

In my hypothesis I expected to see to an increase of right-wing rhetoric and propagandized political speech within the available writings of Jordan B. Peterson over time based on my own personal interpretation of his persona. Though it was clear there was some religious aspect to his positions I initially felt that this element of his popularity was the smallest contributing factor, assuming mostly that his fanbase came more from extremist potentially politically libertarian men. 

This assumption I think, is based primarily on his video interviews, debates and statements I've seen of Dr.Peterson but in large also due to the left-wing media portrayl of him. While researching this project it's easy to see the online discourse attempting to classify Dr.Peterson's ideolgies, methods and stances. Often to opposing degrees. One could essentially find all opinions occuring at once, a hero to some a villian to others. Both cases citing multiple sources. 

I've attempted to do this in two parts, first with his own books, speeches and articles then secondly with his fanbase using Reddit as a community source. In the process of this project I found many areas of interest that could be continued upon and would incorperate more data collection methods including twitter and speech-text procedures.
